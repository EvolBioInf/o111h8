Bacterial genome sequencing is now routine in many clinical
settings. To make the best use of the resulting wealth of sequence
data, it needs to be correctly classified. How to do this at the
subspecies level is the topic of our forthcoming manuscript entitled
\textit{XXX}. In this accompanying tutorial we show in detail how to
reclassify the genomes of a particular target organism,
\emph{Escherichia coli} serotype O111:H8. Serotype O111:H8 belongs to
the ``Big Six'' of food-borne pathogenic \emph{E. coli} that are
associated world-wide with disease outbreaks ranging from
gastroenteritis and bloody diarrhea to potentially fatal
complications, such as acute encephalopathy. One possible use of such
subspecies level genome reclassification is to extract diagnostic
markers from the genomes, and we show how to do that, too.

Since \emph{E. coli} is one of the most intensively sequenced
bacterial taxa, we shall analyze over 7,000 genomes, which takes
perhaps an hour. And while this may seem quick when analyzing all
\emph{E. coli} genomes, any computational workflow with this kind of
run time is difficult to construct, amend, and maintain.

We therefore begin this tutorial in Chapter~\ref{ch:p} with a pilot
study on how to construct a phylogeny from a sample of 50 complete
\emph{E. coli} genomes that contains all 22 complete O111:H8 genomes
in Genbank and 28 closely related genomes. In Chapter~\ref{ch:q} we
show how to query the full phylogeny of 7073 \emph{E. coli} genomes to
identify all genomes of O111:H8. The individual computations necessary
for this workflow take no more than a few seconds on a consumer-grade
laptop thus avoiding the lengthy wait for the underlying distance
computation. In Chapter~\ref{ch:m}, finally, the results of
Chapter~\ref{ch:q} are used to construct diagnostic PCR primers for
O111:H8.
