* Analyzing the Genome Taxonomy of /Escherichia coli/ Serotype O111:H7
Serotype O111 belongs to the "[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9693546/][Big Six]]" /Escherichia coli/ taxa causing
food poisoning in the US and beyond. Here we analyze the subtype with
H7 flagella antigen in the context of all /E. coli/ genomes with a
view to designing serotype-specific diagnostic markers. This analysis
is part of our forthcoming manuscript entitled "Fast ANI Computation
to Assess the Taxonomy of Bacterial Genomes at the Subspecies Level"
