Serotype O111 belongs to the "[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9693546/][Big Six]]" /Escherichia coli/ taxa causing
food poisoning in the US and beyond. In this tutorial we analyze the
subtype with H8 flagella antigen in the context of all /E. coli/
genomes with a view to designing serotype-specific diagnostic
markers. This analysis is part of a forthcoming manuscript.

** Dependencies
This tutorial has five main dependencies:
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors][Neighbors]] for finding target and neighbor genomes
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/][`datasets`]] for downloading genomes
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur][Fur]] for finding unique genome regions
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/prim/][Prim]] for designing PCR primers
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/biobox][Biobox]] for general sequence manipulation

** Download Data Set
Execute `make` to generate the directory `data` containing the
Neighbors database, `neidb`, and the tree of all complete genomes of
/Escherichia coli/, `all.nwk`.
