* Analyzing the Genome Taxonomy of *Escherichia coli* Serotype O111:H7
Serotype O111 belongs to the "Big Six" *Escherichia coli* taxa causing
the bulk of food poisoning in the US and beyond. Here we analyze the
subtype with H7 flagella antigen in the context of all *E. coli*
genomes. This analysis is part of our forthcoming manuscript entitled
"Fast ANI Computation to Assess the Taxonomy of Bacterial Genomes at
the Subspecies Level"
