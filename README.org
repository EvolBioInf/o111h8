* [[https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/jzF2dkp7L5xjqP1][Identifying the Genomes of /Escherichia coli/ O111:H7]]
Serotype O111 belongs to the "[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9693546/][Big Six]]" /Escherichia coli/ taxa causing
food poisoning in the US and beyond. In this tutorial we analyze the
subtype with H8 flagella antigen in the context of all /E. coli/
genomes with a view to designing serotype-specific diagnostic
markers. This analysis is part of a forthcoming manuscript.

Beatriz Vieira Mourato, Sara-Lena Welk, Fabian Klötzl, and Bernhard
Haubold

** Dependencies
This tutorial has six main dependencies:
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors][Neighbors]] for finding target and neighbor genomes
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/][`datasets`]] for downloading genomes
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur][Fur]] for finding unique genome regions
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/prim/][Prim]] for designing PCR primers
- [[https://github.com/evolbioinf/biobox][Biobox]] for general sequence manipulation
- the Unix tools `curl`, `bzip2`, and `zip` for downloading and
  decompressing files
If you are on a Debian system like WSL/Ubuntu, you can install these
dependencies into `~/bin/` by executing `make setup`. Once that's
done, make sure `~/bin/` is in your path by running
#+begin_src sh
source ~/.profile
#+end_src
We have tested this setup on our "minimal box" Docker container, [[https://hub.docker.com/r/haubold/mix][mix]].

** Download Data Set
Execute `make data` to generate the directory `data` containing the
Neighbors database, `neidb`, and the tree of all complete genomes of
/Escherichia coli/, `all.nwk`.

** Tutorial
Having installed the dependencies and downloaded the data, change into
directory `tutorial`. This contains the scripts `pilot.sh` and
`query.sh` described in the [[https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/jzF2dkp7L5xjqP1][doc]].
